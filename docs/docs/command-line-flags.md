title: Command-Line Flags
---

# General Environment Variables

* `JAVA_OPTS`  Default: `-Xmx512m`
    Any options that should be passed to the JVM that marathon will run in.

# Marathon Command-Line Flags

## Core Functionality

These flags control the core functionality of the Marathon server.


### Specifying Command-Line Flags with Environment Variables

The core functionality flags can be also set by environment variable `MARATHON_` + the option name in all caps. For example, `MARATHON_MASTER` for the `--master` option.

For boolean values, set the environment variable with empty value. For example, use `MARATHON_HA=` to enable `--ha` or `MARATHON_DISABLE_HA=` for `--disable_ha`.

You may not both specify the same command-line parameter as an environment variable and an actual command-line parameter.

### Native Package Customization

When using Debian packages, the ideal way to customize Marathon is to specify command-line flags via environment variables, in `/etc/default/marathon`.

### Required Flags

* `--master` (Required): The URL of the Mesos master. The format is a
    comma-delimited list of of hosts like `zk://host1:port,host2:port/mesos`.
    If using ZooKeeper, pay particular attention to the leading `zk://` and
    trailing `/mesos`! If not using ZooKeeper, standard URLs like
    `http://localhost` are also acceptable.

### Optional Flags

* `--access_control_allow_origin` (Optional. Default: None):
    Comma separated list of allowed originating domains for HTTP requests.
    The origin(s) to allow in Marathon. Not set by default.
    Examples: `"*"`, or `"http://localhost:8888, http://domain.com"`.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.13.0</span> `--[disable_]checkpoint` (Optional. Default: enabled):
    Enable checkpointing of tasks.
    Requires checkpointing enabled on slaves. Allows tasks to continue running
    during mesos-slave restarts and Marathon scheduler failover.  See the
    description of `--failover_timeout`.
* <span class="label label-default">v1.0.0</span> `--enable_features` (Optional. Default: None):
    Enable the selected features. Options to use:
    - "vips" can be used to enable the networking VIP integration UI.
    - "task\_killing" can be used to enable the TASK\_KILLING state in Mesos (0.28 or later)
    - "external\_volumes" can be used if the cluster is configured to use external volumes.
    - "maintenance_mode" can be used to respect maintenance window during offer matching.
    Example: `--enable_features vips,task_killing,external_volumes`
* <span class="label label-default">v1.6.488</span> `--deprecated_features` (Optional. Default: None):
    Comma-delimited list indicating which Marathon deprecated features should continue to be enabled. Read more about
    [Deprecation](deprecation.html).
    Example: `--deprecated_features feature_one,feature_two,feature_three`
* `--executor` (Optional. Default: "//cmd"): Executor to use when none is
    specified.
* `--failover_timeout` (Optional. Default: 604800 seconds (1 week)): The
    failover_timeout for Mesos in seconds.  If a new Marathon instance has
    not re-registered with Mesos this long after a failover, Mesos will shut
    down all running tasks started by Marathon.  Requires checkpointing to be
    enabled.
* `--framework_name` (Optional. Default: marathon): The framework name
    to register with Mesos.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.13.0</span> `--[disable_]ha` (Optional. Default: enabled):
    Run Marathon in HA mode with leader election.
    Allows starting an arbitrary number of other Marathons but all need to be
    started in HA mode. This mode requires a running ZooKeeper.
* `--hostname` (Optional. Default: hostname of machine): The advertised hostname
    that is used for the communication with the mesos master.
    The value is also stored in the persistent store so another standby host can redirect to the elected leader.
    _Note: Default is determined by
    [`InetAddress.getLocalHost`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#getLocalHost())._
* `--webui_url` (Optional. Default: None): The url of the Marathon web ui. It
    is passed to Mesos to be used in links back to the [Marathon UI]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/marathon-ui.html). If not set,
    the url to the leading instance will be sent to Mesos.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.9.0</span> `--leader_proxy_connection_timeout` (Optional. Default: 5000):
    Maximum time, in milliseconds, for connecting to the
    current Marathon leader from this Marathon instance.

    Maximum time, in milliseconds, for reading from the
    current Marathon leader.
* `--local_port_max` (Optional. Default: 20000): Max port number to use when dynamically assigning globally unique
    service ports to apps. If you assign your service port statically in your app definition, it does
    not have to be in this range.
* `--local_port_min` (Optional. Default: 10000): Min port number to use when dynamically assigning globally unique
    service ports to apps. If you assign your service port statically in your app definition, it does
    not have to be in this range.
* `--mesos_role` (Optional. Default: None): Mesos role for this framework. If set, Marathon receives resource offers
    for the specified role in addition to resources with the role designation '*'. Marathon currently 
    supports only one Mesos role. Support for multiple roles will be added in the future. _Note: When using Mesos prior to version 1.3, this parameter is applied when the framework registers with Mesos for the first time, and changing it after that has no effect if the framework is re-registered._
* <span class="label label-default">v0.9.0</span> `--default_accepted_resource_roles` (Optional. Default: all roles):
    Default for the `"acceptedResourceRoles"`
    attribute as a comma-separated list of strings. All app definitions which do not specify this attribute explicitly
    use this value for launching new tasks. Examples: `*`, `production,*`, `production`
* `--mesos_user` (Optional. Default: current user): Mesos user for
    this framework. _Note: Default is determined by
    [`SystemProperties.get("user.name")`](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.sys.SystemProperties@get\(key:String\):Option[String]),
    which defaults to the system user as which Marathon is running. The value of this field is only used during initial
    registration, changing it later has no affect.

    delay, in milliseconds, before Marathon begins to periodically perform task
    reconciliation operations.
* `--reconciliation_interval` (Optional. Default: 600000 (10 minutes)): The
    period, in milliseconds, between task reconciliation operations.

    delay, in milliseconds, before Marathon begins to periodically perform
    application scaling operations.
* `--scale_apps_interval` (Optional. Default: 300000 (5 minutes)): The period,
    in milliseconds, between application scaling operations.
* `--task_launch_timeout` (Optional. Default: 300000 (5 minutes)):
    Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a task to enter the `TASK_RUNNING` state
    before killing it. See also `--task_launch_confirm_timeout`.
* `--zk` (Optional. Default: `zk://localhost:2181/marathon`): ZooKeeper URL for storing state.
    Format: `zk://host1:port1,host2:port2,.../path`
    - <span class="label label-default">v1.1.2</span> Format: `zk://user@pass:host1:port1,user@pass:host2:port2,.../path`.
    When authentication is enabled the default ACL will be changed and all subsequent reads must be done using the same auth.
* `--zk_max_versions` (Optional. Default: 50): Limit the number of versions
    stored for one entity.
* `--zk_timeout` (Optional. Default: 10000 (10 seconds)):
    Timeout for ZooKeeper operations in milliseconds.
    If this timeout is exceeded, the ZooKeeper operation is marked as failed.
    This timeout is also used for all REST endpoint operations: if an operation takes longer than this timeout, the request will be answered with a failure.
*  <span class="label label-default">v1.5.0</span> `--zk_connection_timeout` (Optional. Default: 10000 (10 seconds)):
    Timeout to connect to ZooKeeper in milliseconds.
    If Marathon is unable to connect to the ZK cluster during this timeout, Marathon will give up after a few retries.
    In Marathon versions prior to v1.5.0 `--zk_timeout` is used instead.
*  <span class="label label-default">v0.9.0</span> `--zk_session_timeout` (Optional. Default: 10000 (10 seconds)):
    Timeout for ZooKeeper sessions in milliseconds.
    If Marathon becomes partitioned from the ZK cluster and can not reconnect during this timeout then the session will expire and the connection will be closed.
    If this happens to the leader then the leader will abdicate.
    The default value from Marathon version 0.9 to 0.13 (including) was 30 minutes instead of 10 seconds.
* <span class="label label-default">v1.1.2</span> `--zk_max_node_size` (Optional. Default: 1 MiB):

* `--mesos_authentication_secret_file` (Optional.): The path to the Mesos secret
    file containing the authentication secret
* `--mesos_leader_ui_url` (Optional.): The URL to the Mesos master facade. By default this
    value is detected automatically when framework is registered or new Mesos leader is
    elected.
    Format: `protocol://host:port/`
    _Note: When this option is set given url should always load balance to current Mesos master
* <span class="label label-default">v0.10.0</span> `--env_vars_prefix` (Optional. Default: None):
    The prefix to add to the name of task's environment variables created
    automatically by Marathon.
    _Note: This prefix will not be added to variables that are already prefixed,
    such as `MESOS_TASK_ID` and `MARATHON_APP_ID`

    This is the length of time in milliseconds, until a lost task is garbage collected and expunged from the task tracker and task repository.
    Since v1.4.0 an UnreachableStrategy can be defined per application or pod definition.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.15.4</span> `--task_lost_expunge_initial_delay` (Optional. Default: 5 minutes):

    This backup can be used to restore the state at that time.
    Currently two providers are allowed:
    - File provider: file:///path/to/file
    - S3 provider (experimental): s3://bucket-name/key-in-bucket?access_key=xxx&secret_key=xxx&region=eu-central-1
      Please note: access_key and secret_key are optional.
      If not provided, the [AWS default credentials provider chain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) is used to look up aws credentials.

    if Marathon should enable maintenance mode support. See the [maintenance mode docs](./maintenance-mode.html) for
    more information.

## Tuning Flags for Offer Matching/Launching Tasks

Mesos frequently sends resource offers to Marathon (and all other frameworks). Each offer will represent the
available resources of a single node in the cluster. Before this <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span>,
Marathon would only start a single task per
resource offer, which led to slow task launching in smaller clusters.


### Marathon after 0.11.0 (including)

In order to speed up task launching and use the
resource offers Marathon receives from Mesos more efficiently, we added a new offer matching algorithm which tries
to start as many tasks as possible per task offer cycle. The maximum number of tasks to start on one offer is
configurable with the following startup parameters:

* <span class="label label-default">v1.4.0</span> `--max_instances_per_offer` (Optional. Default: 5): Launch at most this
    number of instances per Mesos offer. Usually,
    there is one offer per cycle and slave. You can speed up launching tasks by increasing this number.
    
To prevent overloading Mesos itself, you can also restrict how many tasks Marathon launches per time interval.
By default, we allow 100 unconfirmed task launches every 30 seconds. In addition, Marathon launches
more tasks when it gets feedback about running and healthy tasks from Mesos.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--launch_token_refresh_interval` (Optional. Default: 30000):
    The interval (ms) in which to refresh the launch tokens to `--launch_token_count`.
* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--launch_tokens` (Optional. Default: 100):
    Launch tokens per interval.

To prevent overloading Marathon and maintain speedy offer processing, there is a timeout for matching each
incoming resource offer, i.e. finding suitable tasks to launch for incoming offers.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--offer_matching_timeout` (Optional. Default: 3000):
  <span class="label label-default">v1.5.0</span> The default value was 1000 in Version 0.11.0 until 1.5.0
    Offer matching timeout (ms). Stop trying to match additional tasks for this offer after this time.
    All already matched tasks are launched.
    Note: A small timeout could lead to ineffective offer matching. 
          A big timeout can lead to offer starvation in a cluster with a lot of frameworks. 

All launched tasks are stored before launching them. There is also a timeout for this:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--task_launch_confirm_timeout` (Optional. Default: 300000 (5 minutes)):
  Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a task to enter the `TASK_STAGING` state before killing it. Also see `--task_launch_timeout`.

When the task launch requests in Marathon change because an app definition changes or a backoff delay is overdue,
Marathon can request all available offers from Mesos again -- even those that it has recently rejected. To avoid
calling the underlying `reviveOffers` API call to often, you can configure the minimal delay between subsequent
invocations of this call.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--min_revive_offers_interval` (Optional. Default: 5000):
    Do not ask for all offers (also already seen ones) more often than this interval (ms).

The order in which mesos receives `reviveOffers` and `declineOffer` calls is not guaranteed. Therefore, as
long as we still need offers to launch tasks, we repeat the `reviveOffers` call for `--revive_offers_repetitions`
times so that our last `reviveOffers` will be received after all relevant `declineOffer` calls with high
probability.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--revive_offers_repetitions` (Optional. Default: 3):
    Repeat every reviveOffer request this many times, delayed by the `--min_revive_offers_interval`.

If you want to disable calling reviveOffers (not recommended), you can use:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.11.0</span> `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`

When Marathon has no current use for an offer, it will decline the offer for a configurable period. This period is
configurable. A short duration might lead to resource starvation for other frameworks if you run many frameworks
in your cluster. You should only need to reduce it if you use `--disable_revive_offers_for_new_apps`.

* `--decline_offer_duration` (Default: 120 seconds) The duration (milliseconds) for which to decline offers by default.

* <span class="label label-default">v1.6.x</span> `--gpu_scheduling_behavior` (Default: undefined) Defines how offered GPU resources should be treated. Possible settings are `undefined`, `restricted` and `unrestricted`. Read more about [Preferential GPU scheduling](preferential-gpu-scheduling.html).


### Marathon after 0.8.2 (including) and before 0.11.0

In order to speed up task launching and use the
resource offers Marathon receives from Mesos more efficiently, we added a new offer matching algorithm which tries
to start as many tasks as possible per task offer cycle. The maximum number of tasks to start is configurable with
the following startup parameters:

* <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span> `--max_tasks_per_offer` (Optional. Default: 5): Launch at most this
    number of tasks per Mesos offer. Usually,
    there is one offer per cycle and slave. You can speed up launching tasks by increasing this number.

* <span class="label label-default">v0.8.2</span> `--max_tasks_per_offer_cycle` (Optional. Default: 1000): Launch at
    most this number of tasks per Mesos offer cycle.
    A larger value speeds up launching new tasks.
    Yet, choosing a too large value might overwhelm Mesos/Marathon with processing task updates.

**Example**

Given a cluster with 200 nodes and the default settings for task launching. If we want to start 2000 tasks, it would
take at least 10 cycles, because we are only starting 1 task per offer (and hence 200 per cycle), leading to a total maximum of 200. If we
change the `max_tasks_per_offer` setting to 10, we could start 1000 tasks per offer cycle (the default setting for
`max_tasks_per_offer_cycle`), reducing the necessary cycles to 2. If we also adjust the `max_tasks_per_offer_cycle `
to 2000, we could start all tasks in a single cycle (given we receive offers for all nodes).

**Important**

Starting too many tasks at once can lead to a higher number of status updates being sent to Marathon than it can
currently handle. We will improve the number of events Marathon can handle in a future version. A maximum of 1000
tasks has proven to be a good default for now. `max_tasks_per_offer` should be adjusted so that `NUM_MESOS_SLAVES *
max_tasks_per_offer == max_tasks_per_offer_cycle `. E.g. in a cluster of 200 nodes it should be set to 5.

## Web Site Flags

The Web Site flags control the behavior of Marathon's web site, including the user-facing site and the REST API.

### Optional Flags

*  <span class="label label-default">Deprecated</span> `--assets_path` (Optional. Default: None): Local file system path from which

    current leader. Does not apply when using the deprecated sync proxy.
* `--[disable_]http_compression` (Optional. Default: enabled): Specifies whether Marathon should compress HTTP responses
    for clients that support it. Disabling will reduce the CPU burden on Marathon to service API requests.
*  <span class="label label-default">v0.10.0</span> `--http_max_concurrent_requests` (Optional.): the maximum number of
    concurrent HTTP requests, that is allowed concurrently before requests get answered directly with a
